 DAILY NOTES
 Last update: 19 December 2017 @ 16:08CST

---------------------------------------------

 [Here is the link to the online Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing) where you can volunteer to present a reading to the class.

---------------------------------------------

This page has two functions: (1) it will be used for immediate short-term, day-to-day planning, and (2) a review of what has taken place in each class session.  You can use this to get a sense of what I am planning for each session, based on the materials and rough agenda outlined on the Resources page.  

**Please check this page often as it will be updated VERY frequently.**

As you scroll down, you will find that most dates will have two sections associated with them.  **PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA** will signpost upcoming activities, announcements, deadlines and general miscellaneous items as well as provide a rough outline for that particular day.  The **CLASS NOTES** section is a re-cap of what we actually did that day in class.  

<hr>

# MODULE 1 (Weeks 1 and 2)

# 4 January 2018

**PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA**

- Where to go for information:   
    - Check "The Important Stuff" folder on Nexus.
    - The "Readings and Resources" Google Spreadsheet tells you pretty much what and when you need to be reading.  Students registered in the course will be expected to volunteer to present these readings.  If you wish to volunteer, [go to the Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing).  Remember, volunteering/presenting goes toward your contribution grade.
    - The "Daily Notes" page is more or less the course blog, even thought it's a static website that appears [here](http://dtduval.github.io/Daily-Notes/).  You should be checking this page several times a week, if not more often.  It is already long and populated with all kinds of things, but it will get longer.
    - My [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:dtduval) has quite a few links organised by module (e.g., 4220-1 for Module 1), and I will be adding to these as we go along in the course.  
    - [Nexus](http://nexus.uwinnipeg.ca/) also contains a few documents and items specific to each module that I did not (or could not) make public due to copyright issues or logistics.  Nexus is also where I will post your grades (usually as a .pdf with just your student number).  Finally, note that there is a specific section dedicated to the major research paper on Nexus (more later).
- As a further reminder, if everyone uploads a photo of themselves to Nexus, that would be helpful as I can use it to learn your names much more quickly.
- As you will be writing a research paper for this course, [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1piETwGKGkrYe4LuPUn97E8xlTqQdZkUAjGMEOd7kv-c/edit?usp=sharing) to go to a public Google Doc spreadsheet where you can indicate your topic area, name and email if you wish to link up with others in the class writing on something similar.  This is a good way to form a study group to share resources, references, etc.
- Reminder: please DO NOT email me through Nexus.  Instead, email me directly on [da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca](mailto:da.duval@uwinnipeg.ca)
- Note that there are four modules in this course.  These are detailed in the course outline.
- To speed up access to the journal article readings for this course, use this link](http://cufts2.lib.sfu.ca/CRDB/MWUC/resource/6456) to connect to Google Scholar via the UWinnipeg library system.  From there, enter the name of the article and you'll be able to access a .pdf.

- We will do roundtable introductions and a review of course objectives.

- Guest speakers this semester: Diane Gray (CentrePort), Mariette Mulaire (WTC Winnipeg), Barry Rempel (WAA), Greg Dandewich (Economic Development Winnipeg)

- Readings to be assigned today for this Module.  See the [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing).

**CLASS NOTES**


---------------------------------------------

# 9 January 2018

**PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA**

- We will continue populating the Google spreadsheet with volunteers to start covering some of the readings.  So, if you are interested in any of the upcoming readings (look specifically at Module 1 readings to start with) go to the [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing).

- Discussion question: What indicators can we say point to the extent of internationalisation that a company undertakes?


**CLASS NOTES**



---------------------------------------------

# 11 January 2018

**PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA**

- Please read through the first three chapters of the textbook by today.
      - In particular, let's recap Figure 2.2 from the textbook.


- I would also like to discuss MNEs a bit in the first part of the class, in particular listing out some reasons why a firm might become a MNE (building on the various mechanisms - i.e., exporting, licensing - we discussed last class that a firm can use to _become_ internationalised).

- We will focus a bit on globalisation in Module 1, and some of the readings (journal articles) for this module are directed at this.  It's a massive topic, highly relevant to how business is undertaken internationally, and in some cases very controversial.  Here are some **background** online articles that you might want to read/skim before class (not necessarily for presentation by volunteers, and not to be considered examinable):

# MODULE 3

# 9 February 2017

**PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA**

- Just a few more points from the 7-11 case study to cover today.

- We will then move into climate change (perhaps spilling over to the next class), particularly in the context of how the policies associated with it create uncertainty in the international business environment.

- The Stern Review can be accessed [here](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm), but see also a summary by [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk).

- I may start with some wider principles/arguments, after which we can move into some of the readings, in the following order:

    2.  Curtis, F. (2009) "Peak globalization: Climate change, oil depletion and global trade", *Ecological Economics* 69(2):427–434.

    3.  Dietz, S. and Stern, N. (2008) "Why Economic Analysis Supports Strong Action on Climate Change: A Response to the Stern Review’s Critics", *Review of Environmental Economics and Policy* 2(1):94–113.

    4.  Caney, S. (2010) "Markets, Morality and Climate Change: What, if Anything, is Wrong with Emissions Trading?", *New Political Economy* 15(2):197–224.

    5.  Neumayer, E. (2007) "A missed opportunity: The Stern Review on climate change fails to tackle the issue of non-substitutable loss of natural capital", *Global Environmental Change* 17(3-4):297–301.


**CLASS NOTES**

- Thanks (and apologies again!) to Brianna for very nicely covering off the Ellis article - such an important article that somehow slipped off my radar.
- Good start on the climate change material.  Please be sure to read the Caney, Curtis and and Neumayer articles for after the spring break.  There is some really interesting bits in each that I'll to tease apart.
- [Here is a link to the Maker City book](https://makercitybook.com) I was talking about.
- See the updated info below on the mid-term on Tuesday.


---------------------------------------------
# 14 February 2017

**THE MID-TERM EXAM (9 February 2017 @ 17:37CST)**

- You will be asked to answer three questions.  I will post these up on the screen or write them out on the blackboard.

- The mid-term will include all the readings (text and journal articles) from Modules 1 and 2 up to (and including) 9 February.  I will not be testing, however, on the initial climate change material that we started on 9 Feb.  

- The questions on the exam will be intentionally very broad.  This gives you an opportunity to demonstrate that you have done the readings (including the textbook, cases, journals articles) and listened in class.  The best marks will be reserved for those who can weave concepts and examples together to (1) answer the question, (2) show why the question is important and (3) demonstrate you understand the wider context of the question.  

- The rule of thumb for what readings are examinable: (1) any reading deemed examinable will be indicated on the Resources page, and (2) if we discussed it in class, it should be considered examinable (note that I have taken pictures of the blackboard and posted them up under the specific "class notes" section for some dates above).  That said, when I post links to other ancillary readings on this "notes" page, some of those *may* be helpful to you in this exam in answering one or more questions (although the questions will not be directly based on these ancillary readings).

**CLASS NOTES**

---------------------------------------------
# 16 February 2017

# MODULE 5

# 16 March 2017

- Welcome to Module 5
- Module 5 is the largest, both in terms of topics to cover, textbook readings and case studies.  In short, lots of stuff to sink our teeth into, and it should be quite fun.
- You should read Chapters 8 through 15 in the text for this Module (skipping Chapter 11).    
- As well, we will be looking at three case studies: 'Cameron Auto Parts (A and B)', 'The Expresso Lane to global markets', and 'Walmart's African Expansion'.    

**PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA**

- For this first class, I'd like to weave in some broad concepts from Chapter 8 (Multinational Strategy) of the text.  There are some things in Chapter 2 that I'd like to (re)introduce as well.

- I also want to bring in some strategy options for multiproduct firms, specifically centralisation, replication, vertical specialisation, branching and multi-sourcing.

- From Nexus, download the file titled "CHAPTER-2-handout-for-module-5" as we might refer to this a few times over the next few weeks.

- Module 5 readings:
