<p>Last update: 24 December 2015 @ 21:43CST</p>

<p>This page provides full details on subjects and topics for each of the modules in the course. Note that this course is not planned and executed on a class-by-class basis; rather, the approach is very fluid and organic, giving enough time to cover the broad subject matter but, at the same time, allow for discussions and specifics to be emergent.</p>

<p>For each module, volunteers will be sought to cover off specific readings or cases. Those volunteers will be expected to give a synopsis of their reading and lead the class in a brief discussion. Naturally, these activities play a role in your contribution grade in the course.</p>

<h3 id="moduleone">MODULE ONE</h3>

<p>The purpose of this module is to critically evaluate the current state of globalisation and its impact on international business initiatives. We will focus on globalisation as a concept and how it is manifested, but we will also explore critiques of the <em>practice</em> of globalisation by multinational firms (and governments, to some extent). From this, we will explore recent movements toward regionalism and nationalism and discuss what impact this can have on business activities and transactions.</p>

<p>Handouts: See Nexus for handouts for this module.</p>

<h3 id="moduletwo">MODULE TWO</h3>

<p>The wider international business environment is the focus of this module. Here we will explore the diverse social and culture dimensions that impact international trade, investment, and commerce. This will also lead us to discuss ethics from an international perspective, including an investigation of global efforts at mitigating climate change. </p>

<p>We will also be doing a group exercise in this module. A handout will be distributed.</p>

<h3 id="11february:mid-termexam">11 February: MID-TERM EXAM</h3>

<p>The exam will be three short-answer questions and will be held in-class.</p>

<h3 id="modulethree">MODULE THREE</h3>

<p>As an extension of Module Two, the wider international business environment also takes into consideration global politics and law, how states regulate business activities, and competition policy. We will also explore in–depth how transformative political and legal structures can impact on internationalisation efforts of firms. We will examine trade costs (e.g., transport, customs, currency and transaction costs) and consider carefully regional trade blocs and integration, free trade principles and policy and emerging markets. Quantitatively, we will investigate the nature of political and operational risk in multinational strategy using in–class exercises. We will also consider gravity models. Finally, we will consider some of David’s research on the international trade of commercial air services.</p>

<h3 id="modulefive">MODULE FIVE</h3>

<p>For Module 5, which is the largest in the course, there are quite a few chapters to cover (nominally, these will be Chapter 8 through 15). We will also be exploring/discussing/debating the case studies for the course.</p>

<p>This module shall explore the role of transnational corporations and their role in global production networks, entry modes, the role of technology (and knowledge transfer), strategies for negotiation, and international HR and organisation structuring models. We will also use quantitative techniques to assess short- and long-run multi-country production strategies.</p>
