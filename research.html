<p><strong>TOURISM AND AVIATION: CRITICAL LINKAGES (2009 - 2012)</strong></p>

<p>From 2009 to 2012, whilst based in the School of Business at the University of Otago, I served as Principal Investigator on a competitively-funded project based in New Zealand that sought to explore the complex linkages between tourism and aviation. Co-investigators for the project included <a href="http://aaronschiff.net">Dr Aaron Schiff</a> of the respected Auckland-based consultancy firm, Covec, as well as <a href="http://globalchange.mit.edu/about/our-people/personnel/all_id/180">Dr Niven Winchester</a> (now at MIT, but formerly in the Department of Economics at the University of Otago). A 2009 item in the New Zealand Herald <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/5089285ce4b012753ffd2e1d/508928b5e4b007273cd26a44/508928b5e4b007273cd26a46/1350686261065/">profiled the project</a>.</p>

<p>Some outputs from this project have been released publicly and can be found below. Relevant academic articles and publications are listed in <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/461710/DuvalCV.pdf">my CV</a>. Specific reports from Covec include the following:</p>

<p><strong>PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOHISTORY OF THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN</strong></p>

<p><em>As part of my Master of Arts in Anthropology (University of Manitoba), Professor Louis Allaire (now retired) and I undertook a survey in 1993 and 1994 of key locations on the island of <a href="http://www.svgtourism.com/">St Vincent</a> in the Eastern Caribbean. The 1994 field season included some test pits at various sites along the Windward (East) coast. </em><em>In the interest of disseminating the original results of this research, which would have otherwise been almost impossible to locate, I have made the following freely available:</em></p>
