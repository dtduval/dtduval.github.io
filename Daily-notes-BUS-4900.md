 [Here is the link to the online Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReG39yWJv5-_fNC0bEEAHVCr825dX3QoiEOxM7E6RSs/edit?usp=sharing) where you can volunteer to present a reading to the class.

This is a test.

This page has two functions: (1) it will be used for immediate short-term, day-to-day planning, and (2) a review of what has taken place in each class session.  You can use this to get a sense of what I am planning for each session, based on the materials and rough agenda outlined on the Resources page.  

**Check this page often.  It will be updated frequently.**

As you scroll down, you will find that most dates will have two sections associated with them.  **PROCEDURAL NOTES AND AGENDA** will signpost upcoming activities, announcements, deadlines and general miscellaneous items as well as provide a rough outline for that particular day.  The **CLASS NOTES** section is a re-cap of what we actually did that day in class.
